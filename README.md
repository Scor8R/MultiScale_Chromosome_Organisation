**An experimentally-informed polymer model reveals high resolution organization of genomic loci**

The blob_analysis.py code needs four input files to compare the blob distribution for two different gene loci. 

The first two files are related to gene1, and the other two are related to gene2.

The first file with respect to any gene contains multiple conformations throughout the simulation, and another file shows the index value of the nucleosome out of all the beads in the polymer chain.

Before running the code, confirm that all the confirmation counts and the number of beads mentioned in the code, respective to the target region are correct.

To run the code one can simply command "python3 blob_analysis.py"
